HackLime
========
> Sublime-Text Editor plugin to compile/run using HackerEarth's [API](http://api.hackerearth.com)

###Installtion:
* Copy it in 'HackLime' folder of your sublime package directory
* Edit `client_secret` in `config.py` with your secret key
* It is ready to work

###How to use:
> for both windows and linux

* *ctrl+shift+c* : compile the current open file
* *ctrl+shift+r* : run the current open file
* *ctrl+alt+h* : open help guide for HackLime

###How it works:
* HackLime is built on top of HackerEarth's API
* On a compile/run command it opens a output file, showing output details

###TODO
* I'm thinking of an Installtion script to help installing it.
* Status showing analysis of relative result of all responses.
